# Fuel feedback from hackathon

- Declaration order matters in Sway (have do define "Claim" before "storage").
- Can't import modules.
- The licenses are weird. Can we really publish `fuels` under Apache-2 when `fuel-core` uses the `BUSL-1.1` license?
- Predicate root in multisig walkthrough mismatch. Also bug in example contract.
- Script hash bin didn't match the observed script hash
